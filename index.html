            <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.</p>

            <h1>AGENT ROLES</h1>
            <article>
              <p>Each of the aforementioned roles is used to describe the specialties of the agents and their respective kits, all of which we will describe briefly. However, it is also important to note beforehand that roles do not have to constraint your playstyles. After all, VALORANT, in its very essence, is just a game of clicking heads. If you can click heads better than your opponent, then you will most likely win the game regardless of what role you are using. Agent roles are in the game to simply give players a heads up on how to use their kit for the benefit of the team.</p>
              <p>Before a match starts, players will have an opportunity to select the agent they wish to play, referred to in-game as agent select. Assembling a well-balanced line-up of agents can go a long way to improving the chances of winning a match.</p>
              <p>Within the game, agents are broken down into four general roles: Sentinels; Controllers; Initiators; and Duelists. These roles are then broken down into more specialised positions such as Support, In-game Leader, Entry Fragger, Lurker, Recon, and Crowd Control. Each role is defined by the abilities the agent brings to the match.</p>

              <div class="duelists">
              <h2>DUELIST</h2>
                <p>Duelists are the offensive experts in VALORANT with abilities that allow them to be aggressive and self-sufficient when creating opportunities to engage with opponents. There are currently six Duelists in the game: Jett; Phoenix; Raze; Reyna; Yoru and Neon.
                <p>Duelists are expected by their teammates to be proactive and are the stars within the team that garner the most amount of kills. They will typically fulfill the role of Entry Fragger, being the first person to enter an area of the map in contention and perform high-risk, high-reward actions to gain an advantage. The Duelist role is particularly volatile and leads to players experiencing a feast-or-famine scenario in performance, thus teams should give these roles to teammates with excellent aim.</p>

            <h2>INITIATOR</h2>
              <p>Initiators excel at gathering information and controlling the movements of opponents through the use of their abilities. There are four Initiators in VALORANT: Sova; Skye; Breach and KAY/O. Sova and Skye rely on their abilities to perform reconnaissance in an area while Breach and KAY/O specialise in disrupting enemies in their path through the use of their crowd control abilities.
              <p>Sova and Skye abilities allow for them to recon areas of the map where the opponents may be contesting and convey this information to their team. Breach and KAY/O on the other hand use their abilities to flush out and disrupt opponents in hard-to-reach locations from relative safety. While Initiators are in a category of their own, they could easily perform the defensive role of a Sentinel or Controller, or take a more proactive role like a Duelist.</p>
